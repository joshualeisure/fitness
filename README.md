# Description
Created an exercise/fitness tracker application using Svelte that can record a userâ€™s exercise statistics, sending statistics/data to PostgreSQL, and retrieving that information so the user can monitor their progress/development. In addition to Svelte to build the user interface, I used HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and Bootstrap. To communicate with the database, I used Node.Js and Express for my back-end. For quality of life, I used Nodemon to continuously update my back-end, Docker to isolate my application, and DBeaver to interact with my database easier.
The main features the user has is the ability to track different exercise plans that can be retrieved from the database. In return, it will populate the page with information in a user-friendly format so the user can view their previous workouts, add to them, as well as edit the program.
