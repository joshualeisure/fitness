# Description
- A project designed to record a user's exercise statistics like exercises, weight used, reps, etc...
- Currently, the project has changed several times, with the ultimate goal and design changing as well. Therefore, an accurate README will be added once it is closer to completion. 
- The goal in mind is to create an exercise tracker that the user can use to create multiple exercise plans with.
- Using this plan, they would be able to update their statistics so they can track their numbers over time.
